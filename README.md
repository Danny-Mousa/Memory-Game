## Game Rule:
>The gameplay rule is very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

## Instructions :
   - The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
   - The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card      with the same symbol.
   - If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
   - If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down

## The Challenge:
>The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched,
but the challenge is to end the game with less time and less moves.

## Additional Features
`1`- you can see your four previous results in the "previous results" dashboard
    because i have used the **_`localStorage`_** `javascript property` to store the
    following info for every turn:
  - The number of star(s) at the end of the game
  - The number of moves at the end of the game
  - The time he/she took to complete the game
   
`2`- This game is fully Accessible by keyboard, you can play it and navigate among 
game cards and navigate over across the main page, `current result` popup dashboard , and `previous results` popup dashboard by using the following:
   - Inside the main page, you can use :
      * `tab` and `shift+tab` for forwarding  &  backwarding navigating. 
      *  when you reach the game board you can use `up`, `down`, `right`, and `left` arrow buttons in addition to `tab` and `shift+tab`.
      *  `enter` or `space` to flip the card.
   - And at the popup dashboards you can use `tab` , `tab+shift`, `arrow buttons`
        to navigate among interactive elements, and `enter` or `space` to activate the functionality which related to it.

`3`- And finally, it is `fully responsive` with all different device sizes ,beginning from `360 px` screen width as a lowest screen width
## Expected question:
 Why did you store only 4 results ?
> Because I found that is enough to show that the results of this game can be stored locally and permanently on the local machine, and if you want i can alter the js code for you to store an infinite numbers of the previous results
